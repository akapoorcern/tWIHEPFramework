TODOs:

JES and JER uncertainties are not treated the same
Electron ID currently uses cut-bsaed. Implement MVA ID
Also other selection requirements can be changed.
Do jets need a similar thing to electrons and muons where they have different classes? Like Tight or Veto or whatever? 
Unisolated leptons have been cut.
Remove MET_xy variables
Change the way leptons are selected so thta we don't have to read from the tree four times every event
