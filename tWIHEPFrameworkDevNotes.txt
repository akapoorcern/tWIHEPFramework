Utilities to make generic:

createPlots
makeFileLists.py


TODOs:

Trigger cut in config?
JES and JER uncertainties are not treated the same
Electron ID currently uses cut-bsaed. Implement MVA ID
Also other selection requirements can be changed.
Unisolated leptons have been cut.
Remove MET_xy variables
Pileup/lepton reweighting. In fact the weight class needs to be basically re-done based on nano information?
Jet ID should be moved to the config

Make the example executable much more basic.

Done:

Change 'AddCuts' to 'AddAction'
  - Added in AddAction for generic actions (think EventWeight)
  - Added in AddHists which are not allowed to reject events
All objects are now read directly from input tree and labelled as tight, veto, etc if they pass each separate set of requirements.
  -Do jets need a similar thing to electrons and muons where they have different classes? Like Tight or Veto or whatever? 
  -C hange the way leptons are selected so thta we don't have to read from the tree four times every event
